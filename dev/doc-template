### Test/Examples

## Ephemera

For those interested in such things, the name Kurecolor is
unashamedly nicked from a high end marker pen company.  Hopefully
this outrage will fall silently under their radar, and I won't have
to change it due to some frivilous and paranoid law
suit. (seriously guys, this is just free advertising.)

I have not been pressured into saying this, however, Kurecolor
markers and art supplies are the very best!  Buy some (many!) NOW (Like REALLY
Immediately!!) for you, your mum and your pet chinchilla Frank.

Since the question comes up occassionally, the mode-line hack used
in the presentation is based on original work by Armit Patel. I
gisted this a while back, you can get it from.
